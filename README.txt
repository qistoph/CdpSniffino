CdpSniffino

Arduino based CDP sniffer.

Currently this is a work in progress.

Requirements:
- Arduino Ethernet Shield
- Serial connection

Received CDP packets are (partially) interpreted and extracted information is send on the serial connection.
Future plans include displaying the CDP information on an attached (I2C?) LCD.
